###__**04.09.2017:**__ [Version 0.3](download.md) released!

---

This release introduces a new command line interface for running simulations in batch mode, without opening the GUI. This way Bow Simulator can be called from other programs for performing more advanced computations like parameter studies and optimizations.

The [user manual](resources.md) has been updated with detailed specifications of the input and output formats and an example for using Bow Simulator with the Python programming language.

###__**06.08.2017:**__ [Version 0.2](download.md) released!

---

Did I say the previous version was a complete redesign? Well, here's another one. This time the changes are

* A new tree based bow editor
* A 3d view of the limb geometry
* Many minor improvements and bugfixes

Unfortunately there is also some bad news: No more Mac OS support for now. I previously used a virtual machine to compile the Mac version of this program, but it stopped working and I couldn't manage to set it up again (Mac OS can be really tricky without Apple hardware). So in order to not delay this release any further I decided to give up on that for now.

###__**25.12.2016:**__ [Version 0.1](download.md) released!

---

This is the first release of Bow Simulator, a complete rewrite and redesign of it's predecessor [Bow Simulation Tool](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowsimulationtool).
It comes with many improvements such as

* A more user-friendly interface
* Improved simulation performance
* Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)

The internal redesign of the program lays the groundwork for new features like simulating laminated bows, which is planned for one of the upcoming versions.
Thank you for your interest and stay tuned!
