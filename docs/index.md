# VirtualBow
<h3>Bow and arrow physics simulation for Windows, Linux and Mac</h3>

---

VirtualBow is a free, open-source software tool for designing and simulating bows.
It allows users to quickly and easily test new ideas and optimize their designs before actually building them.
The simulation results include a variety of static and dynamic characteristics such as deformation, draw curve, material stresses, arrow velocity and degree of efficiency.

Please note however that this software is still somewhat immature, so don't trust the results too much yet and report any bugs that you find.

For more details see the screenshots and feature list below or have a look at the [user manual](resources.md).
The latest version of the software can be found at the [download page](download.md). Visit our subreddit [r/VirtualBow](https://www.reddit.com/r/VirtualBow) for news, support and general discussion.
