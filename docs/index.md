# Bow Simulator
<h3>Bow and arrow physics simulation for Windows and Linux</h3>

---

Bow Simulator is a free, open-source software tool for simulating the physics of bow and arrow.
Users can create virtual bow designs and calculate static and dynamic characteristics such as deformation, draw curve, material stresses, arrow velocity, degree of efficiency and more.
This allows for evaluating and optimizing bow designs before actually building them.

Please note however that this software is still somewhat immature, so don't trust the results too much yet and report any bugs that you find.

For more detailed information see the feature list below or have a look at the [user manual](resources.md).
