# Bow Simulator
<h3>Bow and arrow physics simulation for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X</h3>

---

Bow Simulator is a bow and arrow design tool that allows you to create virtual bows and simulate their performance.
It can calculate a wide range of static and dynamic characteristics such as the draw curve, material stresses, arrow velocity and degree of efficiency.
It can be used for evaluating and optimising bow designs before actually building them.

Bow Simulator is free open-source software released under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).

## Features

---

**Graphical Bow Editor**

* Load and save your designs
* Specify limb profile, cross sections and other parameters
* Limitations for now:
    * Only rectangular, uniform cross sections
    * No string-to-limb contact
    <br><br>

**Static and Dynamic Analysis**

* Simulate the statics and dynamics of the bow (Uses a finite element method internally)
* Static results: Deformed limb shapes, draw curve, stored energy, stress distribution, ...
* Dynamic results: Position, velocity and acceleration of string and arrow, kinetic and potential energy, degree of efficiency, ...
<br><br>

<!--
