## Documentation
---

**[User Manual](../files/user_manual.pdf)** This is the main documentation of VirtualBow.
It provides an overview of the program and its features and shows you how to model and analyze bow designs.

**[Theory Manual](../files/theory_manual.pdf)** The theory manual is still a work in progress and is intended for developers and interested users.
It covers the theoretical and technical details behind the software from the mathematical bow model to the numerical simulation methods.

## Material Data
---

**[The Wood Database](https://www.wood-database.com/)** has average values for the mechanical properties of many types of wood.

**[String material data](../files/test_report_ditf.pdf)** Tensile test results for *Dacron B50*, *Fastflight Plus* and *BCY 452X*, done by the German Institutes of Textile and Fiber Research ([DITF](https://www.ditf.de/)). The report is German, but the results are also found in the user manual.

## Other Software
---

**[Python support code for VirtualBow](https://github.com/maexeler/virtualBow)** This user-maintained project provides various utilities that make interacting with VirtualBow from Python more easy.
Features include working with \*.bow files, running simulations and evaluating \*.res result files.

**[SuperTiller](http://www.buildyourownbow.com/build-alongs/how-to-use-supertiller-build-along/)** Excel spreadsheet by Alan Case for simulating the statics of user-defined bows.
It's probably one of the more well-known bow design tools.

**[Woodbear's Selfbow Design Sheet (zip)](files/woodbears-selfbow-design-sheet.zip)** is an Excel spreadsheet that takes an inverse approach to the bow design problem - it calculates the necessary dimensions for a bow according to a user-defined stress distribution.

**[BowCAD](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bowcad#/)** was a commercialy developed bow design software.
Unfortunately the software seems to be no longer available, which is a shame because it looked really promising.
An archived version of their former website can be viewed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141219170039/http://www.bowcad.com/?page_id=69).
