### User Manual

This is the main documentation for Bow Simulator and how to use it. It gives an overview of the program features, explains all input parameters and simulation results and also contains some background information.

### Technical Documentation

The Technical Documentation is still a work in progress and intended for developers and interested users.
It contains the theoretical aspects that Bow Simulator is based on, including the considerations that led to the mathematical bow model,
the derivation of the equations of motion and the numerical solution methods.

### Bow Design

Bow Simulator can be used to evaluate specific bow designs, but it doesn't really tell you how to design a good bow.
If you want to learn about bow design you could have a look at the following sources:

* *The Traditional Bowyer's Bible*, Volume 1, Chapter 3: *Bow Design and Performance* by Tim Baker.
All the common design elements and their performance implications are explained in a very practical and understandable way.

* The [article on bow design](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Bow_design) from the [crossbow building wiki](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Crossbow_Building_Wiki) is also a good read.
It is of course geared towards crossbows but most of it also applies to bows in general.
