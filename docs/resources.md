### User Manual

The User Manual gives you an overview of the program features, explains all input parameters and simulation results and also contains some more background information.

### Technical Documentation

The Technical Documentation is geared towards developers and interested users who want to know exactly what the program is doing behind the scenes.
It contains all the theoretical work that Bow Simulator is based on, including the considerations that led to the mathematical bow model,
the derivation of the equations of motion and the numerical solution methods used to obtain the final results.

### Bow Design

Bow Simulator allows you to evaluate specific bow designs, but it doesn't really tell you how to design a good bow.
If you want to learn about bow design you could have a look at the following sources:

* *The Traditional Bowyer's Bible*, Volume 1, Chapter 3: *Bow Design and Performance* by Tim Baker.
All the common design decisions and their performance implications are explained in a very practical and understandable way.

* The [article on bow design](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Bow_design) from the [crossbow building wiki](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Crossbow_Building_Wiki) is also a good read.
It is obviously geared towards crossbows but most of it also applies to bows in general.

* [*SuperTiller*](http://www.buildyourownbow.com/build-alongs/how-to-use-supertiller-build-along/) is an Excel spreadsheet made by Alan Case for simulating the statics of user-defined bows.

* [*Woodbear's Selfbow Design Sheet [zip]*](files/woodbears-selfbow-design-sheet.zip) by David Dewey is an Excel spreadsheet that calculates the necessary dimensions for a bow according to a user-defined stress distribution.

* [*BowCAD*](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bowcad#/) was the only commercial attempt at bow design software that I know of. They started an Indiegogo campaign and even offered different kinds of licenses on their website. Unfortunately it seems to be gone now.

* [*DrawCurve Calculator*](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cdsnyder/drawcurve/) by Chris Snyder is a utility program for visualizing a bow's draw curve and calculating the stored energy.

* [*x-Ballistics*](http://www.x-ballistics.eu/cms/home/) is a browser based application that can simulate the exterior ballistics/trajectory of arrows.
