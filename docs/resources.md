### User Manual

This is the user documentation for VirtualBow. It gives an overview of the program features, explains all input data and simulation results and also contains some additional background information.

### Theory Manual

The Theory Manual is still a work in progress and is intended for developers and interested users.
It covers the theoretical and technical details behind the software like the mathematical bow model and the numerical solution methods.

### Bow Design

Simulations can be used to evaluate specific bow designs, but they don't really tell you how to design a good bow.
These are some good resources about bow design:

* *The Traditional Bowyer's Bible*, Volume 1, Chapter 3: *Bow Design and Performance* by Tim Baker.
All the common design choices and how they affect bow performance are explained in a very practical and understandable but nonetheless precise way.

* The [article on bow design](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Bow_design) from the crossbow building wiki is also a good read.
It is of course geared towards crossbows but most of it also applies to bows in general.

### Similar/Related Software

* [SuperTiller](http://www.buildyourownbow.com/build-alongs/how-to-use-supertiller-build-along/) is an Excel spreadsheet made by Alan Case for simulating the statics of user-defined bows.
It's probably one of the most well-known bow design tools.

* [Woodbear's Selfbow Design Sheet [zip]](files/woodbears-selfbow-design-sheet.zip) by David Dewey is an Excel spreadsheet that calculates the necessary dimensions for a bow according to a user-defined stress distribution.

* [BowCAD](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bowcad#/) by Joachim Gr√∂ger and Chris Goetz was a commercial attempt at bow design software. At one point they were even offering different kinds of licenses on their website [http://www.bowcad.com/](http://www.bowcad.com/). Unfortunately it seems to be no longer available.

* [DrawCurve Calculator](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~cdsnyder/drawcurve/) by Chris Snyder is a utility program for visualizing a bow's draw curve and calculating the stored energy.

* [x-Ballistics](http://www.x-ballistics.eu/cms/home/) is a browser based application that can simulate the exterior ballistics/trajectory of arrows.
