## Bow Design

* [The Traditional Bowyer's Bible, Volume 1](https://books.google.com/books?id=2O0amwEACAAJ), Chapter 3: *Bow Design and Performance* by Tim Baker.
In this chapter, all the common design choices and how they affect bow performance are explained in a very practical and understandable way.

* The [article on bow design](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Bow_design) from the crossbow building wiki is also a good read.
It is geared towards crossbows but most of it also applies to bows in general.

## Material Data

* [String material tests [pdf]](../files/test_report_ditf.pdf) Tensile test results for *Dacron B50*, *Fastflight Plus* and *BCY 452X*, done by the German Institutes of Textile and Fiber Research ([DITF](https://www.ditf.de/)). The report is German, but the results are also in the user manual.

* [The Wood Database](https://www.wood-database.com/) has average values for the mechanical properties of many types of wood.
