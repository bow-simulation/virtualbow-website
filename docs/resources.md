## Material Data

---

**[The Wood Database](https://www.wood-database.com/)** provides average values for the mechanical properties of many types of wood

**[MatWeb](http://www.matweb.com/)** is a database for material properties that includes many other types of material besides wood

**[String material data](../files/test_report_ditf.pdf)** Tensile test results for *Dacron B50*, *Fastflight Plus* and *BCY 452X*, done by the German Institutes of Textile and Fiber Research ([DITF](https://www.ditf.de/)). The report is German, but the results can also be found in the [user manual](../files/user_manual.pdf).

## Other Software

---

**[Python support code for VirtualBow](https://github.com/maexeler/virtualBow/)** This user-maintained project provides various utilities that make interacting with VirtualBow from Python more convenient.
Features include creation of `*.bow` files, running simulations and evaluating `*.res` files.

**[SuperTiller](http://www.buildyourownbow.com/build-alongs/how-to-use-supertiller-build-along/)** Is an Excel spreadsheet made by Alan Case for simulating the statics of user-defined bows.
It's probably one of the most well-known bow design tools so far.

**[Woodbear's Selfbow Design Sheet (zip)](files/woodbears-selfbow-design-sheet.zip)** is an Excel spreadsheet that takes an inverse approach to the bow design problem - it calculates the necessary dimensions for a bow according to a user-defined stress distribution.

**[BowCAD](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bowcad#/)** was a commercialy developed bow design software.
Unfortunately it seems to be no longer available, which is a shame because it looked really promising.
An archived version of their former website can be viewed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20141219170039/http://www.bowcad.com/?page_id=69).
