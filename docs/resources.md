### User Manual

This is the main documentation for Bow Simulator. The User Manual gives you an overview of the program features, explains all input parameters and simulation results and also contains some tips about bow and arrow simulations.

### Technical Documentation

The Technical Documentation is geared towards developers and interested users who want to know exactly what the program is doing behind the scenes.
It contains all the theoretical work that Bow Simulator is based on, including the considerations that led to the mathematical bow model,
the derivation of the equations of motion and the numerical solution methods used to obtain the final results.

### Bow Design

Bow Simulator allows you to evaluate specific bow designs, but it doesn't really tell you how to design a good bow. If you want to learn about bow design you could have a look at the following sources:

* *The Traditional Bowyer's Bible*, Volume 1, Chapter 3: *Bow Design and Performance* by Tim Baker is probably the most complete work on this topic.
All the common design decisions and their performance implications are explained in a very practical and understandable way.

* The [article on bow design](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Bow_design) from the [crossbow building wiki](http://crossbow.wikia.com/wiki/Crossbow_Building_Wiki) is also a good read.
It is obviously geared towards crossbows but most of it also applies to bows in general.

### Similar Software

* [*SuperTiller*](http://www.buildyourownbow.com/build-alongs/how-to-use-supertiller-build-along/) is an Excel spreadsheet made by Alan Case. It lets you enter the data for your bow and runs a complete static analysis.

* [*Woodbear's Selfbow Design Sheet*](files/woodbears-selfbow-design-sheet.zip) is another Excel spreadsheet, but it uses a different approach: It calculates the necessary dimensions for a bow with a certain user-defined stress distribution. This is a very interesting way to design a bow.

* [*BowCAD*](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bowcad#/) is perhaps the only commercial attempt at bow simulation software so far. It started as an Indiegogo campaign and at one point had an own website where they offered different kinds of licenses, but it seems to be gone now. If you watch their video demonstrations you can see that it also does some design optimization.
