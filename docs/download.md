### Linux

Bow Simulator for Linux is either available as a deb package for debian based distributions or as a [snap package](http://snapcraft.io/), a self-contained package that works across most of the major linux distributions. To work with snap packages you need to have [snapd](http://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install) installed on your system. You can then install Bow Simulator by typing

```text
sudo snap install --dangerous bow_simulator-[...].snap
```
