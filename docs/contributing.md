# Getting Involved

---

There are many ways in which you can help improving this project.
The following sections will give you some ideas, but feel free to [contact me](contact.md) with your own ideas as well.
Any help is appreciated!

### Feedback, Feature Requests and Bug Reports

Tell me what you like and dislike about the program. Was it easy to get started with?
What do you use it for? Are there specific features you wish it had?
And of course be sure to report any bugs or other problems you encounter.

### Software Development

VirtualBow is written in C++ with a Qt GUI.
There are always many things to implement or improve, from the user interface down to the simulation model and the numerical methods.
The source code is hosted at [https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow).
Check out the Readme for build instructions and how to contribute code.
If you need ideas on what to work on, have a look at the [issues](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow/milestones).
Or just get in contact and I will gladly help you getting started.

### Validation of Simulation Results

This is also a very important topic.
If you have used this program to design or model an existing bow, let me know how the simulation compares to reality.
The draw curve of a bow for example is fairly easy to obtain.

Many other simulation results however are difficult to measure, think about material stresses for example.
Therefore someone with access to advanced measuring equipment (things like strain gauges, acceleration sensors, a high speed camera, a tension testing machine, etc.) would be extremely helpful for this project.
