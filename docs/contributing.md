## Getting Involved
---

There are many ways to get involved with this project and help with the development.
The list below might give you some ideas, but feel free to [contact me](contact.md) with your own ideas as well.
Any help is appreciated!

**Feedback, Feature Requests and Bug Reports**

Let me know what you like or dislike about the program.
Was it easy to get started with?
What do you use it for? Are there specific features you wish it had?
And of course be sure to report any bugs or other problems you encounter.
If you have a GitHub account, feel free to participate in the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow/issues) as well.
If you feel adventurous you can also try the [latest development build](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow/releases/tag/latest) and test upcoming features before they are released.

**Software Development**

VirtualBow is written in C++ and uses the Qt framework for the user interface.
The source code is hosted at [https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow).
Check out the Readme for build instructions and how to contribute.
There are always lots of things to implement or improve, from the user interface down to the simulation model and the numerical methods.
Have a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow/milestones) if you need ideas or get in contact with me and I will gladly help you getting started.

**Validation of Simulation Results**

If you have used this program to design or model a bow, let me know how the simulation results compare to the real bow.
Many simulation results however are difficult to measure, think about stresses for example.
Therefore people with access to advanced measuring equipment (things like strain gauges, acceleration sensors, a high speed camera, etc.) could be very helpful for this project.
