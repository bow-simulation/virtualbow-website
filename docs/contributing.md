# Getting Involved

---

There are many ways in which you can get involved in this project and help improving it.
The sections below can give you an overview, but don't hesitate to [contact me](contact.md) with your own ideas as well. Any help is appreciated!

### Feedback, Feature Requests and Bug Reports

Tell me what you like and dislike about the program. Was it easy to get started with?
What do you use it for? Is there a specific feature you wish it had?
Also, be sure to report any bugs or other problems you find.

### Software Development

Bow Simulator is written in C++ with a Qt GUI.
There are always many things to implement, improve or clean up, from the GUI to the simulation model and the numerical methods.
The source code repository is hosted at [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/bow-simulator/bow-simulator/tree/master).
<!--Check out the [Readme.md](...) for build instructions and an introduction to the codebase.-->
If you need ideas what to work on, have a look at the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/bow-simulator/bow-simulator/issues).
I will gladly help you getting started.

### Validation of Simulation Results

This is perhaps the most important work currently.
If you have used this program to design a real bow, let me know how well the simulation matches reality.
The draw curve of a bow for example is fairly easy to obtain.

However, many of the simulation results are much more difficult to measure, material stresses for example.
So if you happen to have access to advanced equipment (things like strain gauges, acceleration sensors, a high speed camera, a tension testing machine, etc.) your help would be extremely valuable for this project.

### Documentation

Help to make sure that the User Manual and/or the Technical Documentation are as complete and comprehensible as they can be.
These documents also need to be kept up to date with new releases of Bow Simulator.
Someone with an outside perspective would be a great help here.

<!--All documentation is written in LaTex, the source files can be found at [https://bitbucket.org/stfnp/bow-simulator-docs](https://bitbucket.org/stfnp/bow-simulator-docs).-->
