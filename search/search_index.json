From now on you can expect your files to keep working with new releases, despite the file format changing every now and then.\n\n\n\n\nThere are also various smaller and larger bug fixes and other improvements.\nMost notably the robustness of the static simulation methods has increased a lot.\nMany bow designs that previously would have crashed the simulation are now possible.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.3 released! \n04.09.2017\n\n\n\n\nThis release introduces a new command line interface for running simulations in batch mode, without opening the GUI.\nThis way Bow Simulator can be called from other programs for performing more advanced computations like parameter studies and optimizations.\n\n\nThe \nuser manual\n has been updated with detailed specifications of the input and output formats and an example for using Bow Simulator with the Python programming language.\n\n\n\n\nVersion 0.2 released! \n06.08.2017\n\n\n\n\nDid I say the previous version was a complete redesign?
