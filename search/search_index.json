Users can create virtual bow designs and calculate static and dynamic characteristics such as deformation, draw curve, material stresses, arrow velocity, degree of efficiency and more. This allows for evaluating and optimizing bow designs before actually building them. Please note however that this software is still somewhat immature, so don't trust the results too much yet and report any bugs that you find. For more detailed information see the feature list below or have a look at the user manual . The latest version of the software can be found at the download section . Visit our subreddit for news, support and general discussion.

The following sections will give you some ideas, but feel free to contact me with your own ideas as well. Any help is appreciated! Feedback, Feature Requests and Bug Reports Tell me what you like and dislike about the program. Was it easy to get started with? What do you use it for? Are there specific features you wish it had? And of course be sure to report any bugs or other problems you encounter. Software Development Bow Simulator is written in C++ with a Qt GUI. There are always many things to implement or improve, from the user interface down to the simulation model and the numerical methods. The source code is hosted at https://github.com/bow-simulation/virtualbow . Check out the Readme for build instructions and how to contribute code. If you need ideas on what to work on, have a look at the issues and milestones . Or just get in contact and I will gladly help you getting started. Validation of Simulation Results This is also a very important topic. If you have used this program to design a real bow, let me know how the simulation compares to reality. The draw curve of a bow for example is fairly easy to obtain. But many other simulation results are difficult to measure, think about material stresses for example. Therefore if you have access to advanced measuring equipment (things like strain gauges, acceleration sensors, a high speed camera, a tension testing machine, etc.) your help would be extremely valuable for this project.","title":"Getting Involved"},{"location":"contributing/#getting-involved","text":"There are many ways in which you can help improving this project.

This has been on the list for quite a while and allows for a much wider range of possible bow designs. As usual there are also various bug fixes, usability improvements and little design changes. For Windows there is now a 64 bit version available in addition to the 32 bit one. Download numbers will decide the fate of the 32 bit version in future releases. For Linux the distribution agnostic download is now an AppImage instead of a snap package . Version 0.4 released! 04.11.2017 The main new features for this release are Contact handling, which allows the simulation of recurve bows Two new simulation results: String force and grip force A compatibility layer for opening older bow files. From now on you can expect your files to keep working with new releases, despite the file format changing every now and then. There are also various smaller and larger bug fixes and other improvements. Most notably the robustness of the static simulation methods has increased a lot. Many bow designs that previously would have crashed the simulation are now possible. Version 0.3 released! 04.09.2017 This release introduces a new command line interface for running simulations in batch mode, without opening the GUI. This way Bow Simulator can be called from other programs for performing more advanced computations like parameter studies and optimizations. The user manual has been updated with detailed specifications of the input and output formats and an example for using Bow Simulator with the Python programming language. Version 0.2 released! 06.08.2017 Did I say the previous version was a complete redesign? Well, here's another one. This time the changes are A new tree based bow editor A 3d view of the limb geometry Many minor improvements and bugfixes Unfortunately there is also some bad news: No more Mac OS support for now. I previously used a virtual machine to compile the Mac version of this program, but it stopped working and I couldn't manage to set it up again (Mac OS can be really tricky without Apple hardware). So in order to not delay this release any further I decided to give up on that for now. Version 0.1 released! 25.12.2016 This is the initial release of Bow Simulator, a complete rewrite and redesign of its predecessor Bow Simulation Tool . It comes with many improvements such as A more user-friendly interface Improved simulation performance Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X) The internal redesign of the program lays the groundwork for new features like simulating laminated bows, which is planned for one of the upcoming versions.

Technical Documentation Bow Design Simulations can be used to evaluate specific bow designs, but they don't really tell you how to design a good bow. If you want to learn about bow design you could have a look at the following sources: The Traditional Bowyer's Bible , Volume 1, Chapter 3: Bow Design and Performance by Tim Baker. All the common design choices and their performance implications are explained in a very practical and understandable way. The article on bow design from the crossbow building wiki is also a good read. It is of course geared towards crossbows but most of it also applies to bows in general.
